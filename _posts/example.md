This is an example post for Jekyll markdown spell-checking.

Some of the front matter items should be ignored by the spelling check.

## Links
Only the link text should be caught by the spell checker, not the URLs.

This is a [correctly-spelled link](https://example.com/rong) and this is an [inccorrectly-spelled link](https://example.com/ronggg). 

This is a [correctly-spelled link][linkurl] and this is an [inccorrectly-spelled link][linkurl], using the link reference style.

[linkurl]: https://example.com/rong
