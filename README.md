# Example spell check

This is an example README file that contains some spelling mistakes in order to test `check-spelling`.

EXXXAMPLE

Link text is checked, but URLs are ignored. [reference style link][link] and [inliiiine style links](https://example.com/spelllllling-mistake)

Image sources should also be ignored, but alt text should be checked:

<img src="/images/example-notword.png" alt="typro in alt">

Inline code in backticks should be `ingnored`, and so should code blocks:

```
badspling in coddde
```
